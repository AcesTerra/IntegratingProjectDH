*************************** RETROSPECTIVE 1ST SPRING ********************************

We finished our first spring objectives, where we defined our webpage topic, branding
and design. However as every new team, not everything was perfect.

In retrospective, we think we can work in two principal points to improve as a team:

    1. Better communication: Clarify from the beginning which part is working each
        member of the team. If help is needed ask for it. Pay more attention to
        our messaging platform.
    2. Avoid delays: Is important to planify better and have clear deadlines, therefore
        we are using from now on a task planner (Trello)
