*************************** RETROSPECTIVE 1ST SPRINT ********************************

We finished our first spring objectives, where we defined our webpage topic, branding
and design. However as every new team, not everything was perfect.

In retrospective, we think we can work in two principal points to improve as a team:

    1. Better communication: Clarify from the beginning which part is working each
        member of the team. If help is needed ask for it. Pay more attention to
        our messaging platform.
    2. Avoid delays: Is important to planify better and have clear deadlines, therefore
        we are using from now on a task planner (Trello)



************************** RETROSPECTIVE 2ND SPRINT *********************************

Second sprint ended and we satisfied all the required tasks on time. Many things were
better comparing to the first sprint. Now there is a better interaction and communication
between the members of the team.

In retrospective, we think we can work in:

    1. Make clear schedules to make meetings at an specific times.
    2. Punctuality: All the members of the team should arrive on time.
    3. Avoid delays: We were able to finish on time. However is important to end things 
       as soon as posible to avoid delays in work of others.


************************** RETROSPECTIVE 3RD SPRINT *********************************

We ended third sprints and AmorPropio web page looks really good. It is important to define
definitive colors so the web page looks more atractive to all users.

Keep the hard work during next sprint!

************************** RETROSPECTIVE 4TH SPRINT *********************************

Work is going really well. We adjust our times and prioritized the task and we were able to deliver
sprint 4 on time.

    1. We will work on a single branch so everyone can see the commits.
    2. We will commit more often to register our changes.
    3. We will work to be in sync with Playground classes.
